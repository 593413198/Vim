# Vim

VSCodeVim is a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension that provides Vim keybindings within Visual Studio Code. 

**Please direct any questions about missing/incomplete features to [our Github Issues page](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues).** We'll do our best to get back to you quickly! We've added a lot of functionality, but everyone uses Vim in their own special way, so let us know if we're missing your favorite obscure command. :wink:

If you want to talk with us directly, drop by our Slack channel above! We hang out there and are pretty friendly :smiley:
